Visual Breakdown:

1. Login Page:

Header: At the top of the page, you’ll have a centered header with a dark background (#333) and
 white text that says "Welcome to Ecoomer - The Eco-friendly Marketplace".
Login Form: Below the header, there's a login form with two input fields: one for the username and
 one for the password. Both fields have placeholder text: "Enter username" and "Enter password".
The fields are styled to be full width, with padding to make them easier to use.
Below the input fields, a green "Login" button is centered. This button will turn a slightly darker 
shade of green when hovered.
Basic Styling: The login form has a white background with rounded corners and a subtle shadow for depth.

2. Shop Page (Item Selection):

Header: This is the same header as the login page.
Items Display: Below the header, there are three items displayed in a 3-column layout:

Item Block: Each item is in a box with an image, a product name (e.g., "Eco Water Bottle"), and the price (e.g., "$15.00").
Select Item Button: Below each item’s name and price, there is a "Select Item" button that the user can click to choose the item.
When clicked, it will display the selected item in the "Selected Item" section.
The items are styled with a white background and a subtle box shadow to give them depth. The images are responsive to the container
width and maintain their aspect ratio.
Responsive Layout: The items are displayed as 3 columns on larger screens, but on smaller screens (e.g., mobile), they will stack to a single column.

3. Selected Item Section:

Display Selected Item: When a user selects an item, it will be displayed in the "Selected Item" section. This section 
has a white background and padding, with a box shadow for a clean and modern look.
Item Details: The name and price of the selected item will be shown in a paragraph element.
Buy Button: A "Buy Now" button will appear below the selected item. When clicked, it will display an alert confirming the purchase.
Hidden by Default: The "Selected Item" section is hidden initially and only becomes visible after an item is selected.
